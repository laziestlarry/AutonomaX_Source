# Value Engineering Playbook (AutonomaX)
Purpose: Maximize commercial & customer value while keeping tech cost and delivery risk low.

## 1) North Star
- Primary KPI: GMV influenced by AI (conversion uplift * sessions)
- Secondary KPIs: AHT in support, LTV, RPR, data freshness (min/hourly), p95 latency

## 2) Top 5 Value Moves
1. **Personalized merchandising** using GA4 → BQ cohorts → Shopify recommendation blocks (server-rendered, cached).
2. **Customer-service auto-resolution** with policy-guarded agent; escalate with structured forms to reduce human time.
3. **Back-in-stock & price-drop intelligence** via Pub/Sub → email/SMS; prioritize high-LTV segments.
4. **Funnel leak fix radar**: automatic detection of step-drop anomalies in checkout and PDP.
5. **Promotions optimizer**: uplift experiments with Looker Studio report (margin-aware).

## 3) Guardrails for Value
- No feature ships without a measurable KPI impact hypothesis.
- Every change has an “abort” switch and simple rollback.

## 4) Rollout Ladder
- Sandbox → 10% canary → 50% → 100% (with SLOs: error<1%, p95<500ms, CSAT>4.5).
