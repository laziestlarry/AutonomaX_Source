AI is here, AI is everywhere: Top companies, governments, researchers, and startups are already enhancing their work with Google's AI solutions.

Published April 12, 2024; last updated April 9, 2025.

Exactly a year ago, we first published this list during Google Cloud Next 24. It numbered 101 entries. 

It felt like a lot at the time, and served as a showcase of how much momentum both Google and the industry were seeing around generative AI adoption. In the brief period of gen AI being widely available, organizations of all sizes had begun experimenting with it and putting it into production across their work and across the world, doing so at a speed rarely seen with new technology.

What a difference a year makes. Our list has grown by 6X. And still, that’s just scratching the surface of what’s becoming possible with AI across the enterprise.

Many of these use cases are coming to life this week at Google Cloud Next 25, as we join with these customers and partners and thousands more in Las Vegas and virtually around the globe.

To name just a few: Wendy’s, Papa John’s pizza, and Uber are all managing orders faster, whether that’s at the drive-thru or through their app with predictive AI tools. Mercedes Benz and General Motors have enhanced in-vehicle services while Samsung’s newest phones and even its in-home robot, Ballie, have more responsive features thanks to AI. Financial institutions like Citi, Deutsche Bank, and Intesa Sanpaolo are providing new services securely, monitoring markets faster, and combatting fraud in novel ways.

[Looking for how to build AI use cases just like these? Check out our handy guide with 101 technical blueprints from some of these real-world examples.]

Given the incredible pace of innovation and progress we continue to see, we are confident that AI will grow beyond even our imagination as our customers continue to challenge us to design, build, deploy, and create value. 

Hopefully you find something here that will propel our own AI endeavors together.

The list is organized by 11 major industry groups, and within those, six agent types: Customer, Employee, Creative, Code, Data, and Security. There are 280 new entries, denoted with an asterisk (*) before the organization’s name.
