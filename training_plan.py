Training and execution plans based on attached specifications.

This module provides functions to interpret highâ€‘level business
strategies and transform them into concrete operational steps for
your AI agents.  The attached documents (e.g. ``Ai Models in
Organization Development.txt``, ``Commander AI and core team roles.txt``)
contain organisational principles and prompts.  While those files
cannot be accessed directly in this environment, this module
defines hooks where you can load and parse that content in your
deployment and feed it into agent workflows.
