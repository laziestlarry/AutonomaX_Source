Market research utilities.

This module contains placeholder functions for performing market
research, analysing trends and competitor behaviour, and computing
pricing and positioning strategies.  In a real system you might use
web scraping, API calls to market data providers or data analysis
tools such as pandas to derive insights.

The functions return simple data structures for demonstration.
