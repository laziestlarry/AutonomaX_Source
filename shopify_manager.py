"""
Shopify product management utilities.

This module provides placeholder functions for updating product
listings, descriptions and images in a Shopify store.  It uses
credentials defined in ``config.py``.  You can extend this module
to synchronise your product catalogue with the results of your
market research or to automate the creation of high quality
visuals.

Functions in this module should communicate with the Shopify API
using REST or GraphQL.  See https://shopify.dev for API details.
